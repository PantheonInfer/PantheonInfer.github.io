              GPUs are increasingly utilized for running DNN tasks on emerging
              mobile edge devices. Beyond accelerating single task inference, their
              value is also particularly apparent in efficiently executing multiple
              DNN tasks, which often have strict latency requirements in applications. 
              Preemption is the main technology to ensure multitasking
              timeliness, but mobile edges primarily offer two priorities for task
              queues, and existing methods thus achieve only coarse-grained
              preemption by categorizing DNNs into real-time and best-effort,
              permitting a real-time task to preempt best-effort ones. However,
              the efficacy diminishes significantly when other real-time tasks
              run concurrently, but this is already common in mobile edge appli-
              cations. Due to different hardware characteristics, solutions from
              other platforms are unsuitable. For instance, GPUs on traditional
              mobile devices primarily assist CPU processing and lack special
              preemption support, mainly following FIFO in GPU scheduling.
              Clouds handle concurrent task execution, but focus on allocating
              one or more GPUs per complex model, whereas on mobile edges,
              DNNs mainly vie for one GPU. This paper introduces Pantheon,
              designed to offer fine-grained preemption, enabling real-time tasks
              to preempt each other and best-effort tasks. Our key observation is
              that the two-tier GPU stream priorities, while underexplored, are
              sufficient. Efficient preemption can be realized through software design 
              by innovative scheduling and novel exploitation of the nested
              redundancy principle for DNN models. Evaluation on a diverse set
              of DNNs shows substantial improvements in deadline miss rate and
              accuracy of Pantheon over state-of-the-art methods.

              <i>1) Online module.</i> This module is the core component for enabling
              preemptive DNN inference. It includes our proposed (i) preemptive
              runtime framework, which consists of a dedicated worker, memory
              manager, runtime queue, etc., as well as (ii) core preemptive task
              scheduling algorithm (ยง3.1). The runtime 
              connects high-priority GPU streams to enable preemption between different 
              real-time tasks. Consistent with existing work, low-priority
              streams are reserved for best-effort tasks. This online module can
              be installed as an intermediary layer between applications and the
              GPU backend without requiring modifications to its deep learning
              framework and the underlying GPU hardware and driver.

              one-time effort when the DNN is registered in the system.

              We first examine the deadline miss rate and accuracy achieved by 
              each method on three mobile edge application involving nine DNN tasks. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Deadline miss rate.</i> From Figure 2(a), we can see that for concurrent DNN tasks, the classical real-time scheduling methods RMS
              and DMS become much less effective, leading to high deadline miss
              rates. RT-mDL can perform model scaling and execution scheduling to better accommodate multiple DNN tasks and significantly
              improve the deadline miss rate compared with RMS and DMS. However, due to its non-preemptive nature, RT-mDL can be affected by
              workload dynamics, which in turn could compromise the predefined schedule and result in missed deadlines. In contrast, Pantheon
              leverages preemption and can further reduce deadline miss rate to
              0.39โ1.10% in three applications, outperforming RMS, DMS, and
              RT-mDL by 92.51โ98.98%, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Accuracy.</i> As real-time task output that misses the deadline becomes invalid, 
              the accuracy of a job is counted as zero if it
              misses the deadline. Thus, the accuracy of RMS and DMS is relatively 
              low in Figure 2(b) due to their high deadline miss rates.
              RT-mDL significantly surpasses RMS and DMS in accuracy, while
              Pantheon can achieve even higher accuracy than RT-mDL in all
              three applications. Overall, Pantheon improves the accuracy by
              69.1โ154.8%, 174.7โ315.5% and 2.2โ46.0% compared to RMS, DMS,
              and RT-mDL, respectively

            </h6>
            <p>
              To further delve into the performance
              gains of Pantheon, we count how often the preemption occurs in
              Figure 9(c). In the traffic application, the workload of DNN tasks is
              relatively lower than other two applications, and about 12% jobs
              need to be preempted, which already leads to substantial performance 
              gains achieved by Pantheon than other methods. As the
              need of preemption further increases, more performance gains are
              obtained in Figure 9, indicating the efficacy of the Pantheon design.

              This paper introduces Pantheon, a new preemption design for
              multi-DNN inference in mobile edge GPUs. The design of Pantheon 
              reveals that the two-tier GPU stream prioritization available
              on mobile edge devices is adequate to enable such services. These
              two tiers of priorities are primarily used to distinguish between
              real-time and best-effort tasks. Preemption between real-time tasks,
              whose priorities change over time, can be further achieved through
              software design. This includes an online runtime with comprehensive 
              preemption logic and innovative scheduling, and offline
              DNN processing. Pantheon does not need to modify deep learning
              frameworks and GPU drivers, making it easy to deploy. Extensive
              experiments show significant improvements in system performance
              compared to state-of-the-art methods.
